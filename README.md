### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Kevin C. 

## About
Full Stack Software Engineer with 2+ years of boot camp and self-taught experience in full stack web and Android development, with an additional 3+ years collaborative experience in the service industry. Looking for opportunities as an entry, intern, or apprentice Software Engineer. Open to front end, back end, full stack or mobile roles.

I love combining code with my other hobbies and interests. For example, the most recent project I launched is a bilingual Chinese-English Dictionary web application featuring a collection of over 121,000 words, word-saving features, 2 practice modules, a built-in Chinese keyboard, and handwriting input. My motivation for building this app is to supplement my desire to learn my heritage language, and I also wanted to address what many web Chinese-English dictionaries are lacking which are features to save words, learn them, and not rely on outside sources for Chinese character input.

I am open to opportunities, so please feel free to connect with me or explore my work through the links below:
