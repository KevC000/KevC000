## Story
I code because I realized I have a passion for combining my passion from my other hobbies and interests with code, and I find great joy in learning new technologies. It began with me making my first Android app, [Handball Court Manager](https://github.com/KevC000/Wall-Handball-Court-Manager) as I was a very avid handball player at the time. I wanted to go further building [miniMAL](https://github.com/KevC000/miniMAL), a project that not only combined my love for anime but also allowed me to experiment with new technologies like Jetpack Compose, Coil, and Retrofit.

To further cement my commitment to Software Engineering, I embarked on a full-stack bootcamp adventure. There, I expanded my technological repertoire with tools like Ruby on Rails, React, and Bootstrap, and brought to life my capstone project: [AniTier](https://github.com/KevC000/AniTier), another testament to blending personal interests with coding. Post-boot camp, my journey continued with projects like [Jade](https://github.com/KevC000/jade-dictionary-web), where I intertwined my fascination for natural language with software development, learning Next, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, Mantine, Firebase, and more along the way.
